My Custom App: "Daily Fortune"

I had a vision for an app where everyday it would give you a fortune and/or inspiration quote for that day.  I tried looking for one on the AppStore and found one called "Daily Fortune," which is very similar to what I had in mind.  However, I would create a different design compared to what the app has.  The app would give a new fortune everyday, after clicking a button.  I was inspired by an app I saw the main character of a show use, that was of the same nature.  I love reading fortunes/quotes that teach me to slow down and take things as life gives them -- it helps me remember that I'm doing great and that everything will be okay!  I'd definitely love to create something of my own like this "Daily Fortune" App, especially since there were barely any apps like it.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- initially it was difficult to find the "Storyboard" file mentioned in Step 3, however, I was able to find that the "Main" file itself was a Storyboard file.
